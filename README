The CBIShell is a frontend to the Pentaho Bi-Server that is easier to use than the default PUC.

It allows users to access reports, dashboards, analysis, etc. 

It runs as a separate webapp and needs Jasig CAS as a SSO to allow access. There is a bit config to set it up...more info coming. 

It is written in Scala, uses Lift, and mostly works (but takes a fair amount of setup, and fiddeling with the default Pentaho setup)

You can see a screenshot under the test directory
